## About

I’m Bera, a security researcher, penetration tester.

I’m interested in how systems **actually fail**, not how they’re described in documentation or compliance reports. If something shouldn’t be possible, that’s usually where I start looking.

## What I spend my time doing

I usually work on: 

```text
web apps
mobile apps
networks
binaries
```

I spend a huge amount of time staring at code like this:

```c
if (len < 0x100) {
    memcpy(buf, input, len);
}
```

and asking myself why anyone thought that was a good idea.

## Side quests

I usually compete on Capture The Flag events (CTFs).
